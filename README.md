# Online Game: RockPaperScissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game made with python

This is a simple project where I made an online game of the famous RockPaperScissors game. The game server will be running for 1 month then I will shut it down due to the hosting cost that I won't be able to afford.
# How To Play?
simple, you download, you will get connected to a game, and wating for another player ,like your friend or any other player in the world, once he opens the game, the game will start.

# How to install?
## 1-For Windows:
Download the PaperRockScissors.msi downloader, and follow the instructions like in the youtube video.

### Side Notes
Pickle the library I am using to send and recieve object to my server is not safe to use, as [CVE-2019-6446](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6446) and many other CVEs show us, the purpose was just to have fun.
