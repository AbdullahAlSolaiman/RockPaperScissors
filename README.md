# RockPaperScissors
A Rock Paper Scissors game made with python

This is a simple project where I made an online game of the famous RockPaperScissors game. The game server will be running for 1 month then I will shut it down due to the hosting cost that I won't be able to afford.


# How to install?
## 1-For Windows:
Download the PaperRockScissors.msi downloader, and follow the instructions like in the video.
## 2-For Linux:
### Dependencies:
Install the dependencies first.

make sure you have pip installed:
```sh
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
```

then install pygame:
```sh
$ sudo pip install pyame
```


then install pygame:
```sh
$ python3 PaperRockScissors.py
```


### Side Notes
Pickle is not safe to use, as [CVE-2019-6446](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-6446) and many other CVEs show us, the purpose was just to have fun.

### Todos

 - Add sounds to the game
 - Track Scores on the Serverside.
